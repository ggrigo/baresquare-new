# Baresquare Website Roadmap

## The Autocompact Principle

This website migration is an **autocompact** of baresquare.com.

Like Claude Code's context compression:
- **96 pages** → **10 pages**
- Full history → Essential summary
- Everything preserved that matters for continuation

### What autocompact teaches us:

| Claude Code | Website Migration |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Keep essential context | Keep brand proof points (SONY, VOGUE, adidas) |
| Discard conversation noise | Deprecate low-value blog posts |
| Preserve the constitution | Maintain brand positioning & values |
| Enable continuation | Structure for future expansion |
| Summary > verbatim history | "Production AI since 2018" > 72 blog posts |

---

## Current State: The Summary

```
/                           LIVE    The compressed homepage
```

**What survived compaction:**
- Brand identity: "Agents that work for you"
- Track record: "Production AI since 2018"
- Proof points: VOGUE (+4% revenue), SONY (40% cost reduction), adidas (30k employees)
- Service architecture: 4 pillars
- Methodology: Human → AI → Metrics

## Deprecated (Compacted Out)

| Old URL | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| `/blog/*` (72 posts) | Low conversion value, high maintenance |
| `/platform` | Product positioning changed |
| `/hire-tywin` | Tywin not in new positioning |
| `/solutions/*` | Replaced by `/services/*` |
| `/apps/*` | Product offerings consolidated |
| `/customer-stories` | Replaced by `/work/*` |
| `/career` | Not priority for v1 |

---

## Redirect Strategy

All deprecated URLs → `/` (homepage)

The homepage IS the summary. It contains enough context to continue the conversation.

---

## Memory Files (Persist Through Compaction)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `CONTENT.md` | What's on the homepage |
| `ROADMAP.md` | Where we're going (this file) |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Technical architecture |
| `.specify/memory/constitution.md` | Design principles |
| `seo-migration/` | Historical record of what was compacted |

---

## Version History

| Version | Date | State |
|---------|------|-------|
| v0 | Pre-migration | 96 pages on baresquare.com |
| v1 | 2024-12-08 | 1 page live (homepage) |
| v2 | TBD | +2 pages (about, contact) |
| v3 | TBD | +4 pages (services) |
| v4 | TBD | +3 pages (case studies) |

## The Insight

> A website refresh is not about preserving everything.
> It's about preserving what matters for continuation.
>
> The old site was the full conversation.
> The new site is the summary that lets you keep working.

  headline: 'We build AI that takes action',
  description:
    'Founded in 2018, Baresquare pioneered action-driven analytics. Today, our autonomous agents help commerce teams move faster than ever.',

  // Story section
  story: {
    badge: 'Our Story',
    headline: 'From dashboards to doing',
    content: [
      'Baresquare started with a simple observation: businesses were drowning in data but starving for action. Teams spent hours in dashboards, hunting for insights they rarely had time to act on.',
      'We built something different. Our AI doesn\'t just surface what\'s happening—it takes action. When inventory runs low, prices shift, or campaigns underperform, our agents respond automatically.',
      'The result? Teams that used to spend 80% of their time finding problems now spend that time solving them.',
    ],

  // Mission section
  mission: {
    badge: 'Our Mission',
    headline: 'Make data work harder than the people using it',
    content:
      'Every insight should lead to action. Every anomaly should trigger a response. Every opportunity should be captured—not just reported.',
  },

  // Philosophy section
  philosophy: {
    badge: 'Our Philosophy',
    headline: 'Action-driven analytics',
    content:
      'Most analytics tools tell you what happened. Ours tell you what to do—then do it. We believe the gap between insight and action is where value is lost. Our agents close that gap.',
    principles: [
      {
        title: 'Insight without action is noise',
        description: 'Every alert we send comes with a recommended action. Every anomaly we detect triggers a response.',

      {
        title: 'Automation should amplify, not replace',
        description:
          'Our agents handle the repetitive work so humans can focus on strategy, creativity, and the decisions that matter.',
      },
      {
        title: 'Speed beats perfection',
        description:
          'A good decision made quickly outperforms a perfect decision made too late. Our agents are optimized for velocity.',

## Fundamentals of AI Prompting

Effective prompting is the key skill for getting value from AI systems. Understanding what makes prompts work helps you get better results faster.

### What Makes an Effective Prompt

**Key elements of strong prompts:**
- **Clarity** - Specific, unambiguous instructions
- **Context** - Relevant background information
- **Constraints** - Output format, length, style requirements
- **Examples** - Show the AI what you want (few-shot learning)

**Prompt structure template:**
```
Role: [Who should the AI act as]
Context: [Background information]
Task: [What you need done]
Format: [How to structure the output]
Constraints: [Limitations or requirements]
```

### Common Prompting Mistakes

- **Vague instructions** - "Make it better" vs "Improve clarity by shortening sentences"
- **Missing context** - Assuming AI knows your situation
- **Overloading** - Too many requests in one prompt
- **Ignoring iteration** - Expecting perfection on first try
- **No examples** - Describing when showing is clearer

## Experimentation vs Frameworks

### Hands-On Experimentation Approaches

**Benefits of experimentation:**
- Discover what works for your specific use cases
- Build intuition about AI capabilities
- Find unexpected applications
- Develop personal prompt libraries

**Experimentation workflow:**
1. Start with a baseline prompt
2. Test one variable at a time
3. Document what improves results
4. Build on successful patterns

### Structured Prompting Frameworks

**Popular frameworks:**
- **CRISPE** - Capacity, Role, Insight, Statement, Personality, Experiment
- **RACE** - Role, Action, Context, Execute
- **Chain of Thought** - Step-by-step reasoning

### When to Use Each Method

- **Experimentation** for novel use cases, creative tasks, exploring capabilities
- **Frameworks** for repeatable tasks, team standardization, production systems

## Advanced Techniques

### Creating Images with ChatGPT

**DALL-E prompt best practices:**
- Be descriptive about subject, style, composition
- Specify art style (photorealistic, illustration, oil painting)
- Include lighting and mood descriptions
- Mention aspect ratio or framing

**Example prompts:**
- "A minimalist tech company logo featuring an abstract neural network pattern, blue and white colors, clean vector style"
- "Dashboard screenshot showing analytics data, dark theme, professional UI design, 16:9 aspect ratio"

### Building Custom GPTs for Specific Use Cases

Custom GPTs extend ChatGPT with:
- Specialized knowledge bases
- Pre-configured instructions
- Custom actions (API integrations)
- Focused conversation flows

**Planning your custom GPT:**
1. Define the specific problem it solves
2. Gather knowledge documents
3. Write clear system instructions
4. Test with real user scenarios
5. Iterate based on feedback

### Fine-Tuning Models for Your Needs

Fine-tuning creates specialized models trained on your data:

**When to fine-tune:**
- Need consistent output format
- Domain-specific terminology
- Unique style requirements
- High-volume, repeatable tasks

**Fine-tuning process:**
1. Prepare training data (prompt/completion pairs)
2. Format as JSONL
3. Upload to OpenAI
4. Run fine-tuning job
5. Test and iterate

## Practical Applications

### Interview Preparation with AI

**AI as interview coach:**
- Generate practice questions for specific roles
- Get feedback on your answers
- Research company-specific topics
- Prepare for behavioral questions (STAR format)

**Sample workflow:**
1. Share job description with AI
2. Request likely interview questions
3. Practice answers and get feedback
4. Research company culture and values
5. Prepare your questions for interviewers

### Business English Mastery

**AI for professional communication:**
- Email drafting and refinement
- Presentation script polish
- Report writing assistance
- Cross-cultural communication tips

**Prompt example:**
"Review this email for a client. Make it more professional while keeping a friendly tone. Highlight any unclear parts."

### Content Optimization and Ad Copy

**AI-powered content improvement:**
- A/B test headline variations
- Optimize for specific audiences
- Maintain brand voice consistency
- Scale content production

**Ad copy framework:**
```
Product: [Your product/service]
Audience: [Target demographic]
Goal: [Click, convert, inform]
Tone: [Professional, playful, urgent]
Constraints: [Character limits, platform rules]
```

## Resources and Tools

### Prompt Libraries and Templates

**Building your library:**
- Save successful prompts with notes
- Categorize by use case
- Include context about when each works
- Version control for improvements

**Community resources:**
- OpenAI cookbook (github.com/openai/openai-cookbook)
- PromptBase marketplace
- Reddit r/ChatGPT prompt threads
- Industry-specific forums

### Testing and Iteration Strategies

**Systematic prompt testing:**
1. Create test cases with expected outputs
2. Run prompts against test cases
3. Score results (accuracy, quality, consistency)
4. Document improvements
5. A/B test in production

**Metrics to track:**
- Task completion rate
- Output quality scores
- User satisfaction
- Time savings vs manual work
